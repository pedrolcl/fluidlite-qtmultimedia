FluidLite MIDI Synthesizer for Qt
=================================

This project is a multiplatform real time MIDI Synth based on the FluidLite Synthesizer with Qt Multimedia audio output.

The library uses Drumstick::RT MIDI input and Qt audio output. Complete compile-time dependencies are:
* Qt5 or Qt6, including QtMultimedia. http://www.qt.io/
* Drumstick 2, for Drumstick::RT MIDI input and for Drumstick::Widgets piano component. http://sourceforge.net/projects/drumstick/

Just to clarify the Drumstick dependency: this project requires Drumstick::RT, but Drumstick does not depend on this project at all.

The project directory contains:
* cmdlnsynth: Command line sample program using the synthesizer library
* guisynth: GUI sample program using the synthesizer library
* libcommon: The synthesizer shared library, using Drumstick::RT and Qt Multimedia
* FluidLite: The FluidLite source files as a git submodule

Hacking
-------

Remember to use `git clone --recurse-submodules` when cloning the repository to populate the working copy with all the sources, including the submodule's.
If you forgot to do that, then you may need to `git submodule update --init --recursive` afterwards.

Use your favorite IDE or text editor with the source files. My preference is QtCreator: https://www.qt.io/ide/
To build, test and debug you may also find QtCreator interesting. You should use CMake (>= 3.14) to configure the project.
